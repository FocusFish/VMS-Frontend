    <h3>Search</h3>
    <div>
      The search field is used for centering the map on a specific ship.<br />
      You can search ships by name in this field and once you have chosen the desired ship in the dropdown the
      map will center around that ship. The dropdown is sorted alphabetically and shows the top 10 results.<br />
      The search will try to find any ship containing that letter combination.
      For Example the search query <b><u>as</u></b> will give you ship sush as <b><u>As</u></b>kungen but also ships like B<b><u>as</u></b>to.<br />
      <br />
      <u>Special commands:</u><br />
      <div class="special_commands">
        <h4>!</h4>
        <div>
          By starting with an exlamation mark the search will instead try to find any ship <u>not</u> containing the given text.
          I.e <b><u>!as</u></b> will give the reverse result.
        </div>
        <h4>/c</h4>
        <div>
          By starting your command with <b><u>/c</u></b> you can go directly to a specific cordinate.
          Example: <b><u>/c 58.43562 17.45620</u></b>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h3>Filter</h3>
    <div>
      The filter field is used for filtering ships that will be shown on the map.
      Just like the search function it will try to find any ship with the text in the name per default.<br />
      <br />
      <u>Special commands:</u><br />
      <div class="special_commands">
        <h4>!</h4>
        <div>By starting with an exlamation mark the filter will instead try to find any ship <u>not</u> containing the given text.</div>
        <h4>/f</h4>
        <div>
          By starting with <b><u>/f</u></b> the filter will instead filter on flagstate.<br />
          Examples:
          <ul>
            <li><b><u>/f swe</u></b> will give you all swedish ships.</li>
            <li><b><u>/f swe,dnk</u></b> will give you all swedish and danish ships.</li>
            <li><b><u>/f !swe,dnk</u></b> will give you all ships that are not swedish or danish.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>&</h4>
        <div>
          Is a separator, by using it you can filter on multiple things. All arguments given to the filter must be true for the ships to be visible.<br />
          Examples:
          <ul>
            <li><b><u>/f swe & ask</u></b> will give you all swedish ships that have ask in the name.</li>
            <li><b><u>ask & /f swe,dnk</u></b> will give you all swedish and danish ships that have ask in the name.</li>
            <li><b><u>!ask & /f swe,dnk</u></b> will give you all swedish and danish ships that dosn't have ask in the name.</li>
          </ul>
